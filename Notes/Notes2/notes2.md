# Lecture 2 Introduction to Linux Notes

1.  ## What is an Operating System?
     - An operatin system provides all fundamental software features of a computer. An OS enables you to use the computer's hardware providing you the basic tools that make the computer useful.
2.  ## What is a kernel?
     - An OS Kernel is a software component that's responsible for managing low-level features of the computer, including the following managing system hardware, memory allocation, CPU time, and program interaction.
3.  ## Which other parts aside from the kernel identfy an OS?
     - Command-Line Shells, Graphical User Interfaces, Utility and Productivity Programs, and, Libraries.
4.  ## What is linux?
     - Linux is a Unix-like Operating System popular in academic and business environments.
5.  ## What is a linux distribution?
     - A complete Linux system package that is entirely open source or free software; however, some include proprietary components and are for sale only, typically with a support contract.
6.  ## List at least 4 linux characteristics:
     - Multitasking, Free and Open Source, Secure and portability.
7.  ## What is Ubuntu?
     - Is a Linux distribution, freely available with both community and professional support.
8.  ## What is Debian?
     - Is an all-volunteer organization dedicated to developing free software and promoting the ideals of the Free Software community.
9.  ## List and define the different types of licensing agreements
     - **Open Source:** the software may be distributed for a fee or free. The source code is distributed with the software.
     - **Closed Source:** the software is not distributed with the source code. The user is restricted from modifying the code.
         - **Freeware:** the software is free but the source code is not available.
         - **Shareware:** the software is free on a trial basis.
     - **Free Software:** the software is distributed woth the source code. The software can be free of charge or obtained by a fee.
10. ## What is Free Software? Define the 4 freedoms.
     - **Freedom 0:** use the software for any purpose.
     - **Freedom 1:** examine the source code and modify it as you see fit.
     - **Freedom 2:** redistribute the software.
     - **Freedom 3:** redistribute your modified software.
11. ## What is virtualization?
     - Createing virtual versions of something.
12. ## List 3 benefits of virtualization
     - Allows running multiple OSs on one machine without dual booting.
     - Allows applications to be tested before installing them on a host machine.
     - Can be used to keep legacy applications sandboxed and running past their end of life.
13. ## What is a hypervisor? Include definitions of the 2 types
     - Software or Hardware in charge of creating, managing, and running virtual machines.
14. ## What is the difference between Guest OS and Host OS?
     - The host operating system is software installed on a computer system that communicates with the underlying hardware. While a guest OS is software that is installed in a virtual machine.
15. ## What is virtualbox?
     - Is a powerful x86 and AMD64/Intel64 virtualization product for enterprise as well as home use.
